    "- a) Your answer here\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: No \n",
    "Reasoning: The add_to_cart method works with objects of type MobileDevice and ServiceContract, which suggests that these classes might inherit from a common superclass like product etc. However, this is an assumption and nothing is specidied explicitly in this area. Hence I have marked answer as No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Yes\n",
    "Reasoning: Polymorphism means one name but different forms. The add_to_cart method can accept different types of objects (e.g., MobileDevice or ServiceContract) and perform a common action (append to self.cart and update self.total). This is an example of polymorphism, where different classes can be treated as instances of a common base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming: Yes\n",
    "Reasoning: Code example in this case defines a class Cart, encapsulates data (such as self.cart and self.total) within objects of that class, and provides a method (add_to_cart) for interacting with those objects. It is also following polymorphism and hence I have marked this question as Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-down Design: No\n",
    "Reasoning: Top-down design refers to a structured approach where a problem is broken down into smaller sub-problems. The provided code snippet doesn't demonstrate this particular approach explicitly. It's a method within a class, which is a part of a larger program, but there's not enough information to determine if it's developed using top-down design. Hence I have marked the answer as No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: No\n",
    "Reasoning: Functional programming focuses on using functions as the primary building blocks of a program. While the add_to_cart method is a function, the overall code snippet and the concept of a shopping cart are more aligned with object-oriented programming than functional programming. Hence I have marked this anwer as No."

    "1] From a storage efficiency standpoint, it would be more efficient to use ASCII encoding for writing a long list of digits (0-9) to a file. \n",

    "2] ASCII encoding uses a single byte (8 bits) to represent each character, which includes the digits 0-9 along with other basic characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme that can use up to 4 bytes to represent characters depending on the character's code point. While UTF-8 is more versatile and can represent a wide range of characters from various languages, for a list of just digits (0-9), it would certainly result in unnecessary overhead in terms of file size compared to ASCII.\n",

    "To create an even smaller file to store the information of a long list of digits, I would consider using compression techniques like gzip etc. Gzip can significantly reduce the file size by compressing the data while ensuring that no information is lost during decompression.

    "\n",
    "1] Check for Missing Values: Ensure that there are no missing values in critical fields. Missing data can lead to unforseen results and incomplete analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Check Data Types: Make sure that data is of the expected type (e.g., numeric, string, date) in each column. Incorrect data types can lead to errors in calculations or comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Check Data Range and Distribution: Examine the ranges and distributions of numeric data to identify outliers or anomalies. Extremely large or small values could indicate errors or data entry issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4] Reconsile Data (count, sum, avg etc): Compare summarized data with external sources or other related datasets to identify inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5] Check Duplicates: Search for duplicate rows. This could inflate or distort analysis results if not reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6] Check Referential Integrity: For relational data, ensure that references between data (foreign keys) are valid and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important to sanity-check your data before you begin your analysis? What could happen if you don't?\n",
    "\n",
    "1] Ensure Data Quality: By identifying and addressing errors or inconsistencies or missing values we can enhance the overall quality and reliability of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Accurate Decision-Making: High-quality data leads to more accurate and informed decision-making. Bad data can lead to incorrect conclusions and misguided actions subsequenltly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Prevent Propagation of Errors: Errors in data can compound (like a chain reaction) as we perform calculations and analyses, potentially leading to insignificant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4] Save Time, Budget and Resources: Detecting and fixing issues early in the process can save valuable time, money and resources that might otherwise be wasted on analyzing flawed data.\n",

    "- d) Your answer here\n",
    "\n",
    "1] Domain Knowledge: I would start by understanding the context of the data and the domain it represents. This will give us insights into which variables are critical to the analysis and might be more prone to errors or inconsistencies otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Data Dictionary: Refer to any available data documentation or data dictionary. It provides information about the meaning, type, and expected values for each variable. This shall help focus on variables with complex definitions or those that are crucial to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3] Data Importance: Identify variables that are core to the analysis goals or hypotheses. Variables that drive key outcomes or decisions should be thoroughly considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4] Frequency and Volume: Variables with high frequency or significant volume of data may have a higher likelihood of errors / issues. We should prioritize variables with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5] Relationships and Dependencies: Consider variables that are related to others, especially those used in calculations, aggregations, or comparisons. Inconsistencies in these variables could have cascading effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "6] Data Entry Points: Variables obtained through manual data entry or data integration processes may have higher chances of errors. These inputs need thorough review.\n",
    "\n",
    "7] Data Transformation : Variables that have undergone data transformations (e.g., normalization, scaling etc) should be checked to ensure the transformations were applied correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "8] Missing Values & Sampling: Prioritize variables with a high proportion of missing values. Missing data can impact analysis results. If applicable, consider performing initial checks on a smaller sample of the dataset before conducting a comprehensive analysis."

    "\n",
    "Your boss comes to you Monday morning and says “I figured out our next step; we are going to pivot from an online craft store and become a data center for genetic disease information! I found **ClinVar** which is a repository that contains expert curated data, and it is free for the taking. This is a gold mine! Look at the file and tell me what gene and mutation combinations are classified as dangerous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you only give your boss the dangerous mutations and include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Gene name\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Mutation ID number\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Mutation Position (chromosome & position)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Mutation value (reference & alternate bases)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Clinical significance (CLNSIG)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Disease that is implicated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The deliverables are the final result as a dataframe with a short discussion of any specifics. (that is, what data you would present to your boss with the explanation of your results)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Limit your output to the first 100 harmful mutations and tell your boss how many total harmful mutations were found in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use the instructor-modified \"clinvar_final.txt\" at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zps0YssoJbZHrn6iLte2RDLlgruhAX1s/view?usp=sharing This file was modified to be not exactly the same as 'standard' .vcf file to test your data parsing skills. **This is a large file so do NOT upload it into your github repo!**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Replace missing values in the dataframe with: 'Not_Given'. Print or display this (including the Not_Given count) for the column `CLNSIG` by using pandas value_counts() function (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) State in your answer how you define harmful mutations\n",

    "**Hints** \n",
    "* We do not expect you to have any medical knowledge to solve this problem; look at the data, read the documentation provided, and write down your assumptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correct pseudocode will give you partial credit so start with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Map out which fields you want to extract: Are they in the same place every time? What strategy will you use to robustly extract and filter your data of interest? How do you plan to handle missing data?\n",

    "* A good way to start is to print out each line, then practice parsing them to see if you can recover the fields of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* A starting solution for parsing .vcfs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/dceoy/99d976a2c01e7f0ba1c813778f9db744 This solution does **NOT** work due to the changes we've made but can be modified to work. As with any solution that needs modifications, it may take less time to make your own solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter out junk and lines with no mutation data. Just focus on the data your need to deliver to your boss. \n",
